AI Response:
"Hey, I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed right now, and it's okay to feel that way. Let’s take it one step at a time. First, take a deep breath. Now, let’s focus on the main tasks you need to tackle today. But before we dive into solutions, I want to understand more about what's on your mind.  
**Follow-up Question:** *What is currently making you feel the most overwhelmed?*

User Input: 
"I have too many projects at once, and I’m struggling to prioritize them."

AI Response:
"Thank you for sharing that. It’s really helpful to know what’s weighing you down. Now, let’s break it down into actionable steps so we can move forward with more clarity. Here are 5 steps to help evaluate and destress:

1. **Prioritize the Projects**: Write down each project you’re working on, then rank them in order of importance or urgency. Which ones need immediate attention? Which can wait?

2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: For each project, define a clear, realistic goal you can complete in a reasonable time frame. This will help you avoid feeling like everything needs to be done at once.

3. **Time Block**: Dedicate specific blocks of time each day to focus on one project at a time. During these blocks, eliminate distractions (turn off notifications, close unrelated tabs).

4. **Delegate or Ask for Help**: If possible, see if there are any tasks you can delegate to someone else or ask for support from your colleagues. You don’t have to do everything on your own.

5. **Practice Deep Breathing or a Short Walk**: When you start to feel overwhelmed again, take a few minutes to do some deep breathing exercises or take a quick walk. It will clear your mind and reduce stress.

Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’ve got this, and I’m here to help you stay on track."

User Input: 
"I want to be more focused on my personal goals, but I’m unsure where to begin."

AI Response:
"That's a great first step—recognizing the need to focus on your personal goals! Let's start by getting clarity on what those goals are. I suggest breaking them down into categories like personal growth, health, relationships, or hobbies. Once we identify these areas, we can prioritize them based on what matters most to you right now. Here's a simple approach to begin with:

1. **Define your goals**: Write down 2-3 key personal goals you want to focus on. Make them specific (e.g., 'I want to read 12 books this year' or 'I want to exercise 3 times a week').

2. **Set a timeline**: For each goal, decide on a timeline. When do you want to achieve them? Setting a timeline helps give your goals a sense of urgency and direction.

3. **Break them into smaller tasks**: Once your goals are set, break each one into smaller, actionable steps. For example, if your goal is to exercise more, start by scheduling 15-minute daily workouts.

4. **Prioritize**: You don't have to tackle everything at once. Prioritize your goals based on what feels most urgent or important to you right now.

What area of your personal life do you feel most drawn to improve right now? We can start from there and make a plan together."
